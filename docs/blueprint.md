# **App Name**: VisionCraft AI

## Core Features:

- AI Backbone Advisor: Backbone Selection Tool: Suggests the best CNN backbone architecture (ResNet, VGG, etc.) based on dataset characteristics and project goals. It uses reasoning to apply rules that might depend on image sizes.
- Detection Head Automation: Detection Head Advisor: Chooses an appropriate detection framework (SSD, FPN, YOLO) based on the selected backbone and dataset. Includes a rule-based tool to include/exclude potential object detection heads depending on the backbone selection.
- Dataset Loader: Dataset Integration: Supports integration with popular open-source object detection datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, and Open Images.
- Interactive Demo: Real-time object detection preview: A module that can receive test data through an upload form and shows the user the model output in a way that they can easily download for use.
